# Ranger

[Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) is a terminal file manager using vim-like bindings.

## Configuration location
The configuration folder is located at `~/.config/ranger/`.

## Files
- The file `rc.conf` contains the commands for ranger. I added image preview and removed the mouse.

- The file `rifle.conf` defines the programs used to open files.
