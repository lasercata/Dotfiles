# Latexmk

Configuration for the LaTeX compiler (which files are cleaned here).
For my LaTeX templates and examples, you can check [this repository](https://github.com/lasercata/latex_templates).

## Configuration location
The configuration file is located at `~/.latexmkrc`.

## File
- `.latexmkrc` : here is used to add extensions of files to clean with latexmk -c (run with `<localleader>lc` from `nvim` with `vimtex`)
