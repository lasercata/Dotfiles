# Polybar
[Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) is a customizable status bar that I use in the i3 window manager. 

It is needed to install `tlp` to have the `wifi` and `bluetooth` commands.

## Configuration location
The configuration folder is located at `~/.config/polybar/`.

## Files
- `config` : the configuration file for polybar ;
- `launch.sh` : launch polybar for each screen.
