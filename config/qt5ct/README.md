# qt5ct
[qt5ct](https://github.com/desktop-app/qt5ct) is a configuration tool for Qt5, that I use to change the theme of KDE apps in i3.

## Configuration location
The configuration folder is located at `~/.config/qt5ct/`.

## Files
- `qt5ct.conf` : the configuration file for qt5ct ;
- `breeze_ff4500_dark.conf` : my custom colors (just changing the blue to the `ff4500` orange) ;
- `Breeze_Dark_ff4500.colors` : this is the file for the KDE colors (change to this using `systemsettings5`).
