This repository contain my personal configuration files for the some softwares that I use. Most are text-based (only run in terminal) and have vim-like key bindings.

See each folder for more info.

There is currently a configuration for these softwares :
    - bash ;
    - elinks (terminal web browser) ;
    - i3wm (keyboard focused window manager) ;
    - kitty (terminal emulator) ;
    - neofetch (display system information) ;
    - neovim (text editor) ;
    - picom (for transparency in i3) ;
    - polybar (status bar) ;
    - qt5ct (fix KDE theme) ;
    - ranger (command line file explorer) ;
    - tmux (terminal multiplexer).

Other useful softwares :
    - zathura (pdf reader with vim-like keys) ;
    - calcurse (terminal calendar, with vim-like keys) ;
